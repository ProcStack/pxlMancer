look at the RDSon of the transistor at 100% drive, full on, with the voltage you have
then V=IR the potential current ignoring the motor's impedance

usual pin ratings are in the range of 10-100mA
with a decent NPN you get 50x, PNP- 100x

or hardware fixes- a discrete pullup of 50k will fix you there
there are design advantages to both
