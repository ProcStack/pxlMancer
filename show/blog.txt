To be completely honest, starting a blog is inducing some cognitive dissonance in my mind.
Starting a blog for someone like me, with no product to talk about or reason to inform or teach, ends up presenting itself as a glorified personal journal.  Some blow hard trying to get out an opinion on topics from the results of an hour or two of google searching.
But with how often I write in my notebooks, there comes a point where reflecting on empirical evidence, with the support of science journal articles, allows me to grow intra-personally.

If people actually cared about the opinions strangers have online, the youtube comments section's would be a lot more civil.

The same diametric thoughts arise when considering creating an outlet for myself on a youtube channel.
I want to get my ideas out, but who am I to make the self-aggrandized assertion to be a louder voice in a group?

This is where I stand and is an accurate foreshadowing of the stances I will take moving forward.
If we don't observe both sides of a situation, then we will become delusioned and enticed by pleasantries and not critical thinking.
