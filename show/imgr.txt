So, I've made a thing (Heads up, its home grown Gif heavy!)

[Pixelmancer loading screen] - http://pxlmancer.com/show/pxlIntro.gif
Out of some 2+ years of on-and-off working, writing over 13000 lines of scripting by my lonesome, and losing quite a bit of sleep recently...
(And boy howdy, do I need to clean my apartment...)
I'm happy to say I put together a fully functioning web graphic web photo modding web app!

I present Pixelmancer!

We're at a point where websites can be anything their hearts' desire.
They can be video editors, cat galleries, music makers, blogs written by cats, games, even throw up an excel spreadsheet to fool the boss; the MCP's the limit!
So, I wanted to make something fun!


I've made plenty of brush effects to confuse the hell out of you, till you find the couple you like and make awesome stuffs with

Just want to mess around? Check out the filters
Ooo, shiny!
But you'll need to turn the quality slider down on firefox... Sorry to the 13% of surfers out there.
(And there are still 9% of surfers using IE??)

Save and load your document where ever you want
..or just save an image, that works too...

Make color swatches you can store to hotkeys, that also save and load with your document.
Cause, I mean hell, it's time consuming getting swatches the way you want.

Layers? Who needs layers?  Oh, right, they are sort of important...

Mobile exists, so why not mess around on the go?
Bookmark it to your homescreen and you can load it up like an app, even with no signal or wifi!
That way, you can pawn it off on your kids to keep them occupied on road trips between cell towers.
Or heck, hog it to yourself!

By now, you might be thinking, 'Ah hell! I'm not on wifi and I just loaded this whole user sub!? Damn it !!1!'
That sucks...I'm sorry...
But you might also be thinking, 'There is too much crap, I don't have time for this.' 
Damn right you don't!
In this social environment, spare time is everything, and getting frustrated at a new web site is the least of our worries.
So hey, just grab some cheesy poofs and sit back while you watch the 'How To'; showing you to thing and how to stuff!
Just wash your hands after though, no one likes a cheesy mouse.

Side note, I feel ads are the bane of my existence on the interwebs. So, from me to you ads, 'I'm not going down without a fight!'
[ Drawing sparkle eyed finn or something similar ] - HARD

Side side note, to the web devs out there, Canvas objects are extremely versatile and fun to mess with, play around with them if you haven't!
HTML5 + Canvas = Swank tank
And if you look at my source code, nawww, I'm not a web dev by trade; I'm sure it shows.
