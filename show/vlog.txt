2_In Group / Out Group - The need to label
----------------------------
Having lived my life not really knowing where I fit in.
Bouncing from outcast, to escapist, to raver, to goth, to metal head, to industrial ... Well, I guess the last 3 are kind of similar in aspects of personality attracted to their sub-culture.
I've been left with more than a few experiences revealing some ingrained notions people hold on different sub cultures.
From my perceived views on the receiving end.
Goth are creepy and most likely drink blood.  Clearly a reasonable target to insult from the side lines.
Metal heads, don't mess with them, they will kick your ass for no reason.
Ravers, they are probably on ketamine, go listen to tiesto.
Escapist, waste of space draining society.
Outcasts, go play DnD you nerd ... Well... DnD is fun, I'd return in the like by telling them to go play fantasy foot ball.
----------------------------
(I need to not do In Group / Out Group so early)
Finding pain within realizing the outgroup is no different than the in group.
BLM, Feminism, SJW, Nerds (The Con)
We all fight many of the same battles, but when we come to realize these problems affect more than the hand full of your personal in group, it seems the only way to respond is through expressing pain and hate.

16_Self Flagellation - B(V)log Voice of an ego
----------------------------
To be completely honest, starting a blog is inducing some cognitive dissonance in my mind.
Starting a blog for someone like me, with no product to talk about or reason to inform or teach, ends up presenting itself as a glorified personal journal.  Some blow hard trying to get out an opinion on topics from the results of an hour or two of google searching.
But with how often I write in my notebooks, there comes a point where reflecting on empirical evidence, with the support of science journal articles, allows me to grow intra-personally.

If people actually cared about the opinions strangers have online, the youtube comments section's would be a lot more civil.

The same diametric thoughts arise when considering creating an outlet for myself on a youtube channel.
I want to get my ideas out, but who am I to make the self-aggrandized assertion to be a louder voice in a group?

This is where I stand and is an accurate foreshadowing of the stances I will take moving forward.
If we don't observe both sides of a situation, then we will become delusioned and enticed by pleasantries and not critical thinking.

From Opposing Forces - Yin Yang
----------------------------
The voice of an Ego

There comes a realization through age and understanding of past experiences which sheds light on thoughts yielding anecdotes and advice.
Should this be indulged, benefits could be had by more than oneself.
It takes a village to raise a child.
Then comes the internet, which has the potential to be one big village.  Yet no one is a fan of imposed influences, unwanted advice, and corrections of one's own habits; unwarranted interjections.

Is the act of creating the video, on a platform where its optional to view said video, make it more alright?
It is the individual's prerogative to view the content after all.

As seen in so many other's situations, strong opinions yield harsh responses.
Middle ground gives a non-confident approach to opinions.
Yet parroting the socially acceptable is worse than selling out.
At least with selling out, it is still yourself, just catering to the perception you've built around your image.

Even with the hate, it seems standing your ground is the most beneficial to growth of userbase and the self.

Even if it comes down to being socially acceptable to make a channel of personal views build off of empirical evidence and subsequent analysis.
There comes the personal introspection building the internalized blackhole of narcissism in the galaxy of modesty.
The blackhole is needed to keep the galaxy alive.
Feeding off the modesty which gets too close and caught in the gravitational pull of narcissism.
The blackhole will sustain itself until it evaporates away.
But seemingly; feeding will keep narcissism around, slowly eating away at modesty. Yet shooting jets of better understood modesty out of the poles, processes and at higher energy.
This creates a climate and weather within the galaxy itself.

There is a need for both aspects in life, no matter how arrogant narcissism seems in our lives.
It is certainly an area of importance to maintain the structure of our lives.
The Yin and Yang of modesty and narcissism.
No one wants to be a roaming blackhole slowly evaporating into nothingness.
But the importance of a blackhole to hold ourselves together in a coherent system.

Question arises, what are the downsides of pure modesty?  Self hatred?
Too much modesty appears as lack of self appreciation.
Pure modesty is akin to pure goodness, being a 'pushover' as it were.
Holding no true form in the universe outside a cloud of dust in the aether.

I'm sure there are people out there who find any ounce of narcissism a turn off.  But one can say this of anyone and any trait.
The thought comes back to the ego.  We are what we are to one's impression.
There is only so much we can or can't do to influence those around us.
We can only embrace and address what fallout comes from our actions.
Take that reaction and utilize it to our self growth.

Growth through personal experience.
Growth through understanding
Growth through action and reaction.

It is what we make of any action.  Our reaction is dependent on who we are on a given day and state of mind.
To me, the best way to understand our Life as it's been is to revisit it.
To come back to the emotional times in life.

The hardest times change us the most.  So to come back and understand out lives with a changed mind helps us continue to grow from the same past events.
With growth, it allows us to better understand ourselves, to better understand our pasts.
The cyclical nature of Life to perpetually grow, day by day.

It seems this might be why our subconscious brings up that stupid thing you said or did back in 5th grade just before falling asleep or in the shower, just to keep your path set in stone.  Rather than to let us wonder off down an unblazed path, to get lost in the woods.

19_Schooling - College
----------------------------
The fault I see in going to college isn't the funds, the self-righteous peers in this day and age, or the bad meal plans.
It's venturing to college thinking you want to be a writer, when clearly you would be better as a biologist.
Surely, you want to be that writer, but one needs to ask themselves, am I going to get a good job doing this?

I was facing the quandary of, should I go into quantum mechanics / fluid dynamics or should I go into computer art.
I looked at my skills critically, my grades, how I partook in both areas.
Man, did I want to get into quantum mechanics....  But I knew I'd make better pay in computer art.
Over a decade later, and I only seemed to ever look back out of wonder, not out of questioning my choice fundamentally.
============================
20_Schooling - Homeschool vs Public
----------------------------
The pros and cons of Homeschool vs Public schooling is quite vast, to say the least.
I've heard many push homeschooling and to not going to college.
And not many to push for public schooling and college.
So I'd like to bring forth my concept on the matter.

Surely, homeschooling allots for a large swatch of material to learn at the rate of the child.  Tailored to their being.
But where does the personal interaction come in?  Who says the material taught in public school is the end all be all of the childs learning experiences day to day?

Personally, having the diverse group of students abound allowed me to grow in interpersonal skills.  Learning that being some fool running around shamelessly embarrassing themselves is something looked down upon.
Yet is a unique personality in the sea of social hierarchy.

24_Judgmental Thoughts
----------------------------
We all fight struggles.  Whether they are day to day or long standing issues.
Yet we are so quick to judge another by their actions at hand.  Lacking any will to look into possible reasons behind the other's actions.

----------------------------

============================
29_The necessity of Strife
----------------------------
I'm noticing more and more, when a specific group has a problem with things, a problem that affects people outside of the group. The group gets pissed they aren't the only ones with the problem. Blm, this YouTube age restrictive thing. Have you even tried watching the free MIT or Berkley videos?
Like being proud to be pissed off. Not even victim complex.
Like some badge of honor. A purple heart in social standing.
This is where our 'great to live in this country' mentality has driven us.
Humans thrive off strife. So we invent it to stimulate our amygdala
============================
30_Inevitability - Lack of ideas for videos
----------------------------
Yes, this was a planned video from the beginning, haha.

============================
31_The Hero's Journey - Feeling a connection to a fictional character -
----------------------------
We are the protagonist in our own story of Life.
============================
32_Layout in our Minds - Pleasing proportions and art.
----------------------------

============================
33_Neuroses - Personal influence of Life
----------------------------
I've mentioned how the influence of Life is like that of Silly Putty taking on print and retaining the ink no matter how far its stretched.
We are all influenced by our past.
We are but complex calculations using variables set from past experiences to drive future outcome.

It must be said that not all neuroses are bad or evil.  They are simply something that drives our responses and actions.

For me, I have a very distinct neurosis, well, I probably have more than one.  But one that drives much of my choices and actions in Life in an inherent need to create and learn.
Its not even for recognition or to impress others. Well, maybe on some subconscious level it is, but consciously, it is not.
The act of creating something because of have the ability, gives me that much sought after release of dopamine and serotonin.
The act of learning something new gives me new tools to use in the future creation of projects.

But, this is something I can't seem to escape from.  Sitting around makes me feel that I'm wasting time.  That I can better use my given resources in a way to grow further.
A perpetual battle to achieve something better than my current state of being.

Putting on that mask just to get by in Life
============================
39_The Quarter Life Crysis
----------------------------
Oi boy, this is going to be a mess of a video.
It seems to happen to everyone I've talked to about this.
Scientists have mentioned it, everyone from Alan Turing to Einstein.
That golden age of 26.
Personally, I've expanded it to more of 25-27, an range of exponential growth.
============================
40_Frequency of Recurrence
----------------------------
Miles stones in Life
Trends averaging 25-30 year time spans.
Social change within the 4 stages of society's sine wave of a Life cycle.
============================
41_That strange sense of ... something is wrong
----------------------------
Sometimes you get that sense something is off, but you can't quite put a finger on it.
I'm one to listen to this feeling, having no understanding of what is truly wrong.
But we must ask the questions to find the answer, one isn't just going to stumble onto the answer to a question not yet asked.  Unless they can retain all of the things every witnesses or understood prior to the questions.
Because you wont know its an answer until the question reveals itself.

For myself, I've been trying to figure out what is missing from our capitalism based consumerist society for ages.
But can't figure out what it is.

============================
42_Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
----------------------------
As previously mentioned, we are all the same.
We are born into this world that has been developed my all of those who came before us.
And I must agree with Primus in their song Hats Off
"""
Hats off to the ones that put it all together
And keep their ducks in line
Hats off to all the ones that erred before me
And taught me how to survive
"""
============================
43_Design - Things I've figured out about design
----------------------------
Rule of 3rds
Simpler is better
Complimentary layout
Complimentary colors
Lighting faults and follies
============================
44_Design - Things I've figured out about creation
----------------------------
The fast way isn't always the best way for developing a creation

Expect the unexpected
Having a plan in mind about the way something works or should work is ideal.
But there will always be situations that arise that will throw wrenches into the development.
Like when making a website, make sure things are modular in functions, or else you'll find yourself rummaging through hundreds of lines of scripting to fix one issue, because everything was developed as one large function.


Getting it working is the number 1 thing at first
Getting it right is number 2

Commenting code..... NO, JUST NO... Dang it... Yes...

Never show something that has blatant issues, even when explicitly telling the person about the issues.
Apparently not everyone actually listens, or will comment on the issue anyway.

============================
45_Advice I wish I heard
----------------------------
Living life to please others is a tiresome journey.
Living life to please yourself is a lonely journey.
Living life to understand yourself opens many more options.
Know the path you are traveling, since we walk it every day.  Know the shortcuts and the ditches to step over.

You're more likely to regret something never done, than to regret something you partook in.
And if you do regret something you did, its a learning lesson, not something to get angry over.
============================
46_If you build it, they will come
----------------------------
I quite honestly have no faith in this statement, even though I say it to myself over and over.
In this age of instant gratification, if something doesn't hit big quick, it fizzles.
When there is so much being created by so many, if one aspect of something is slightly jarring, there are going to be many other clones with slight variations out there.

I spent nearly 8 months, every night after work and every weekend, when not hanging out with friends, dedicated to developing a website.
Hitting over 13000 lines of scripting to create the website.
Yet when I tried to submit it to a few outlets to get some notice.  I was sent a message by a moderator saying the site wouldn't be allowed, that it was self promotion.
Even though it was free, no ads, and simply a donation button.
I was left rather dumb founded.
Over the next few weeks, the visitor count slowly dropped.  Even though return visitors actually stayed up.
I built it, they didn't come in quite the way I was expecting.

============================
47_Freud and the Repetitive Statement
----------------------------
I don't know about you, but I inevitably say 2 phrases to myself over and over randomly in the day.
Neither of which are good.  But its certainly my brain telling me something is clearly wrong that I need to address.

This idea of a Freudian slip, that out subconscious manages to let out a little message through a misstep in verbal conversation.
============================
48_What drives us in life?
----------------------------
Messy room as organized mess, or actual mess
Clean room as anal retentive, or boredom outlet

Material goods vs money vs living life for the betterment of ourselves.
============================
49_Preference
----------------------------
To my understanding, the things we love the most speak the most about who we are.
My favorite song speaks more about my inner self than anything else I've ever heard.  I think this is something that drove my attraction to that song the most.

============================
50_Drugs - The Usefulness
----------------------------
Just a word of warning before you start jumping to conclusions about my stance with this.
There is a difference between recreation and addiction.
It should not need to be said, but I'm sure on this topic, it must.

I'm not going to sit here and tell people to do everything under the sun.  But there are certainly a select few that has helped me through many trying times and held me together when I felt my life was falling apart.
Is this something I'm proud of? Yes.  Did some things end up affecting me in a way I wish never happened? Also yes.
There are a few that allow for expansion of mental comprehension.
Others that put emotion into perspective when sober, allowing for more caution when approaching emotionally trying times between friends or loved ones.
Again, while sober, haha.
Trying to talk to someone about some heavy topic while on shrooms might end badly for both parties.... haha.

http://www.businessinsider.com/brain-on-drugs-scans-2015-2

There is this stigma that drugs are bad, mmmkay?
That there seems to be no benefit in exploring an alternate reality for a night.


============================
51_Drugs - The Downward Battle
----------------------------
We struggly to find a sanctuary in life.
But the harsh reality is, no matter where we go, there is only duct tape holding together bits and pieces of broken egg shell.


============================
52_Drugs - The Uphill Battle
----------------------------
Ending up in the pit of despair with no rope to be thrown down for you to climb out is a hard thing to get around.
The will always be friends to try to help, but when you are in a state of need, a state of strong addiction, help is trying, help is tiresome, help is making it sound like something you are doing is fundamentally wrong in life.
No one wants to hear this.

============================
53_Delayed Potential (Need to finish, this is just from note book)
----------------------------
Reliance on the finite creates dependencies, making it difficult living day to day.
As amazing as it would be to live by the guides of the Bhuddist believe system, practicality in this modern day makes it hard to live by that life style. (Practicality in this modern day makes things difficult.)
Yet we find ourselves embracing material goods which make our lives easier one step at a time.
Standing on the shoulders of giants, as it were.

_Our basic needs haven't changed, only our views of these needs within the structure we put ourselves in within our life styles and our limited time.

This parodies the concept on previous pages.
Through relevant affects of Life choices and wandering minds, we can get caught up within the infinitely expanding digital conscious.
Litigation and inevitable family ties, yield hardships previously decided out of wealth ties and family connection.
Simpler, less ambiguity, fewer Life decisions and potential pain from emotional connection.
The things that make Life worth living, as well as making Life so trying.

We wake up to the same old routines and lives.
We drive to work, get angry at strangers on the road equally as angry as we are.
Get to the grind.
Like it, love it, or hate it; it is the same ol' grind.
Day after day.
Drive home, with a sense of achievement bestowed upon us by a subjective understanding of the work completed.
To a place we call 'Home.'
A vacuous establishment filled with out possessions, our display of Life achievements.
For some, we share Life paths, to discuss the slight deviation in monotony in the day.
But when it comes time...
What has been accomplished?
Economical support?
_Advancing technology to make the giants we stand upon grow?

We grow however we know how.
If that is to grow into stagnation, or to grow into a full fledged Human being.
We are all living the same Lives with different nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
Our choices are our Lives.
We may assume roles and believe some choices are forced.
But these are choices our prefrontal cortex are telling us need to be made.
Empathy is a strong thing when it comes time to making out lives better as a whole.
