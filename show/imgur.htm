<br><b>So, I've made a thing ...</b>

<br>Out of some 2+ years of on-and-off working, writing over 13000 lines of scripting all by my lonesome, a lot of learning, and losing quite a bit of sleep in the last couple months...
<br>(And boy howdy, do I need to clean my apartment...)
<br>I'm happy to say I put together a free fully functioning web graphic, web photo modding, web app!
<br>
<br>I present Pixelmancer!

<br>We're at a point where websites can be anything their hearts' desire.
<br>They can be video editors, cat galleries, music makers, blogs written by cats, games, even throw up an excel spreadsheet to fool the boss; the Master Control Program's the limit!
<br>I wanted to make something fun!  So, why not an online graphics editor??
<br>
<br>
<br>I've made plenty of brush effects to confuse the hell out of you, till you find the couple you like and make awesome stuffs with

<br>
<br>
<br>Just want to mess around? Check out the filters
<br>Ooo, shiny!

<br>But you'll need to turn the quality slider down on firefox... Sorry to the 13% of surfers out there.
<br>(And there are still 9% of surfers using IE?!?)
<br>
<br>
<br>Save and load your document where ever you want
<br>..or just save an image, that works too...

<br>
<br>
<br>Make color swatches you can store to hotkeys (0-9), that also save and load with your document.
<br>Cause, I mean hell, it's time consuming getting swatches the way you want.

<br>
<br>
<br>Layers? Who needs layers?  Oh, right, they are sort of important...
<br><img src='http://pxlmancer.com/show/pxlLayers.gif' style='width:720;height:auto;'>
<br>
<br>
<br>Mobile exists, so why not mess around on the go?
<br>Bookmark it to your homescreen and you can load it up like an app, even with no signal or wifi!
<br>(Progressive Web Apps for the win!)
<br>That way, you can pawn it off on your kids to keep them occupied on road trips between cell towers.
<br>Or heck, hog it to yourself!
<br><img src='http://pxlmancer.com/show/pxlMobile.gif' style='width:720;height:auto;'>
<br>
<br>
<br>By now, you might be thinking, 'Ah hell! I'm not on wifi and I just loaded this whole user sub!? Damn it !!1!11'
<br>That sucks...I'm sorry...
<br>But you might also be thinking, 'There is too much crap, I don't have time for this...'
<br> 
<br>Damn right you don't!
<br>In this social environment, spare time is everything, and getting frustrated at a new web site is the least of our worries.
<br>
<br>So hey, just grab some cheesy poofs and sit back while you watch the 'How To'; showing you to thing and how to stuff!
<br>Just wash your hands after though, no one likes a cheesy mouse.

<br>
<br>Side note, I feel ads are the bane of my existence on the interwebs. So, from me to you ads, 'I'm not going down without a fight!'
<br>
<br>Side side note, to the web devs out there, Canvas objects are extremely versatile and fun to mess with, play around with them if you haven't!
<br>HTML5 + Canvas = Swank tank
<br>And if you look at my source code, nawww, I'm not a web dev by trade; I'm sure it shows. It's just a fun hobby in my free time.
